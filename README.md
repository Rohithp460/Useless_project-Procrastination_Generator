## **Project Description**

_This project is an intentionally “useless” application designed to give you a task for one purpose only: to procrastinate in the most creative way possible. Complete a task to receive… another task!_

**Purpose:** This app’s playful randomness is aimed at killing free time with a twist!

---

## **The Problem (that doesn't exist)**

We all have moments when we aimlessly scroll through social media to kill time. So why not change that? The **Procrastination Generator** invites you to get some equally aimless, random, and absurd tasks done instead!

## **The Solution (that nobody asked for)**

This app provides an alternative to overthinking and scrolling by keeping you mildly occupied with random, trivial tasks — each completed task comes with the “reward” of another equally amusing task.

## **Technical Details**

**Technologies/Components Used**

- **Language:** Flutter (Dart)
- **Libraries:** Built-in libraries

### **Implementation**

2. Enjoy endless procrastination!
